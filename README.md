# Monster-Mapper
Somewhere off in the distance we've always seen the blurry outlines of giants, sea serpents and dragons. Even in an age of total information like this one we've believed in creatures that haunt our basements or descend from the sky to erase our memories.

Monster Mapper is a paranormal activity tracker for just such occurences.

## Features

### Single Page Application

This application lives on a single page and renders data dynamically with the help of Javascript.

### Leaflet

This project uses the Leaflet plugin to map data across the world. Custom icons and a custom map background were added thanks to Leaflet's powerful capabilities.

### Giphy Search

Monster Mapper uses the Giphy API to help folks search for useful gifs to add to their sightings. This is a fun testing feature and it might get removed in upcoming versions. 

Users can also link to their own uploaded media.

### Hidden Games

Users can come across all sorts of hidden gems across the map. These include hidden monsters, a chase after King Kong, and (if they type in the correct witchy phrase) a total restyling of the map.
