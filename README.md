# Monster-Mapper
Somewhere off in the distance we've always seen the blurry outlines of giants, sea serpents and dragons. Even in an age of total information like this one we've believed in creatures that haunt our basements or descend from the sky to erase our memories.

Monster Mapper is a paranormal activity tracker for just such occurences. It utilizes Javascript, Leaflet, Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL to provide an enjoyable experience for amateur investigators of the supernatural.

## Single Page Application

This application lives on a single page and renders data dynamically with the help of Javascript.

## Leaflet

This project uses the Leaflet plugin to map data across the world. Custom icons and a custom map background were added thanks to Leaflet's powerful capabilities.

## Backend

The backend for this app uses Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL as a server API and database.
