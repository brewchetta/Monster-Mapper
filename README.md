# Monster-Mapper
Somewhere off in the distance we've always seen the blurry outlines of giants, sea serpents and dragons. Even in an age of total information like this one we've believed in creatures that haunt our basements or descend from the sky to erase our memories.

Monster Mapper is a paranormal activity tracker for just such occurences. It utilizes Javascript, Leaflet, Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL to provide an enjoyable experience for amateur investigators of the supernatural.
