# Monster-Mapper
Paranormal activity mapping app that utilizes Javascript, Leaflet, Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL to provide an enjoyable experience for amateur followers of the supernatural.

## Single Page Application

This application lives on a single page and renders data dynamically with the help of Javascript.

## Leaflet

This project uses the Leaflet plugin to map data across the world. Custom icons and a custom map background were added thanks to Leaflet's powerful capabilities.

## Backend

The backend for this app uses Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL as a server API and database.
